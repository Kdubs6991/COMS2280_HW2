/**
 * The {@code InsertionSorter} class extends {@link AbstractSorter} and
 * implements the <b>Insertion Sort</b> algorithm for sorting an array of
 * {@link Student} objects.
 *
 * <p><b>How it works:</b> Insertion Sort builds a sorted prefix of the
 * array one element at a time. For each index {@code i}, the element
 * {@code students[i]} is removed and inserted into its correct position
 * among {@code students[0..i-1]} using the comparator configured via
 * {@link AbstractSorter#setComparator(int)}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Comparator behavior:</b> All ordering decisions are delegated to
 * the comparator stored in {@link #studentComparator}. That comparator
 * determines whether the sort is by GPA (order 0) or by credits (order 1),
 * using the tie-breaking rules defined by the assignment.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Stability:</b> This implementation is <i>stable</i> with respect to
 * {@link #studentComparator}; equal elements retain their original relative
 * order.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Complexity:</b> Worst/average time {@code O(n^2)}; best case
 * (already sorted) {@code O(n)}. Extra space {@code O(1)}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Student[] a = {
 *     new Student(3.8, 90),
 *     new Student(2.7, 75),
 *     new Student(4.0, 120)
 * };
 *
 * InsertionSorter sorter = new InsertionSorter(a);
 * sorter.setComparator(0);   // 0 = GPA desc, then credits desc
 * sorter.sort();             // sorts the internal copy held by the sorter
 * }</pre>
